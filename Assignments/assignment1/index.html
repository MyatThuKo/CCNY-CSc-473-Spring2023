        <h2>Why did you register for this course?</h2>
        <p>
          &emsp; Web development is the first class I took when I was at BMCC
          back in 2017 and that's when I just started majoring in Computer
          Science. I am not really good at designing a website and it's been
          awhile doing web development since I have been focusing more on the
          iOS development. I am taking this class to brush up my web dev skills
          and hopefully be able to do freelancing on web development.

          What's an interesting fact about you that isn't likely to be true
          about anyone else in the course?
        </h2>
        &emsp; It'd be the fact that I have more than 200 hotwheels and about 50
        funko pops at home. Currently they're in the box somewhere in the
        storage room at my house since I just recently move to a new place.
      </li>
      <li>
        <h2>Anything else you want me to know?</h2>
        &emsp; Nothing as of now, I am currently building a portfolio website to
        showcase my projects and if I can get some help on hosting the website
        it'd be much appreciated.
